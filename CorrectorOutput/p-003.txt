dc.description: In this pen and ink sketch, Nandalal has depicted a cow grazing ona
patch of grass as it is followed by three birds. He has employed soft, fluid lines to
render the scene, adding life and vitality to it. Nandalal had a strong affinity for
sketching, his subjects being the surrounding environs, people in their everyday life
or anything that he found fascinating. His sketches provide a moving record of the
modest life and natural environment in which he lived. This album of 24 works from
the late years of his career, largely records line drawings of animals and birds, witha
few detailed renditions. Some of these subjects, he has executed repeatedly,
studying them in varied postures. About the depiction of animals, in his book,’ Vision
and Creation’, Nandalal elaborates, "Each creature has a basic spinal rhythm
following its characteristic nature...A certain kind of movement or rhythm finds
expression in the body of an animal following each emotional impulse, and this
becomes for us its characteristic gesture... These body rhythms are based on the
structure of the backbone, and this is seen most clearly from the side. The body's
mass, structure and volume should be studied in relation with this life rhythm; it
controls them and, in turn, is controlled by them." This sketch was signed 'Nanda'
and dated '22.1.56' in Bengali at the bottom-right corner of the sketch.
