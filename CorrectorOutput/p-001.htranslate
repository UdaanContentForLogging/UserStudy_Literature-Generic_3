    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 131 623 2417 917;">
     In this first sketch of a series of four sketches of ducks in the album, Nandalal has depicted a duck from various angles and studied its movements in simple line drawings.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 130 859 2436 1153;">
     Nandalal had a strong affinity for sketching, his subjects being the surrounding environs, people in their everyday life or anything that he found fascinating.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 132 1095 2324 1259;">
     His sketches provide a moving record of the modest life and natural environment in which he lived.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 132 1213 2326 1496;">
     This album of 24 works from the late years of his career, largely records line drawings of animals and birds, with a few detailed renditions.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 129 1450 2373 1614;">
     Some of these subjects, he has executed repeatedly, studying them in varied postures.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 132 1568 2378 1850;">
     About the depiction of animals, in his book,' Vision and Creationâ€™, Nandalal elaborates, "Each creature has a basic spinal rhythm following its characteristic nature...A
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 132 1804 2419 2086;">
     certain kind of movement or rhythm finds expression in the body of an animal following each emotional impulse, and this becomes for us its characteristic gesture...
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 133 2040 2277 2211;">
     These body rhythms are based on the structure of the backbone, and this is seen most clearly from the side.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 130 2158 2457 2448;">
     The body's mass, structure and volume should be studied in relation with this life rhythm; it controls them and, in turn, is controlled by them."
