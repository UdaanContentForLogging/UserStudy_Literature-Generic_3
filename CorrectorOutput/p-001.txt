dc.subject: Drawing Artwork Sketch

dc.publisher: National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi

dc.description: In this first sketch of a series of four sketches of ducks in the album,
Nandalal has depicted a duck from various angles and studied its movements in
simple line drawings. Nandalal had a strong affinity for sketching, his subjects being
the surrounding environs, people in their everyday life or anything that he found
fascinating. His sketches provide a moving record of the modest life and natural
environment in which he lived. This album of 24 works from the late years of his
career, largely records line drawings of animals and birds, with a few detailed
renditions. Some of these subjects, he has executed repeatedly, studying them in
varied postures. About the depiction of animals, in his book,' Vision and Creationâ€™,
Nandalal elaborates, "Each creature has a basic spinal rhythm following its
characteristic nature...A certain kind of movement or rhythm finds expression in the
body of an animal following each emotional impulse, and this becomes for us its
characteristic gesture... These body rhythms are based on the structure of the
backbone, and this is seen most clearly from the side. The body's mass, structure
and volume should be studied in relation with this life rhythm; it controls them and, in
turn, is controlled by them."
